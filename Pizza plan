Pizza Prject

 * Create a website for a pizza Place
 * Allow user to choose 1 or more toppings
 * Choose a size
 * Display a final cost
-----
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size
* Create prototype method for cost depending on selection
-----

If all objectives met :
* Style with CSS
* Add images
* Display list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked on for details
* Delivery option that requires address


PLAN

Make a pizza order form
that has different pizza topping options
that can be clicked to add to pizzas
also make the pizza two different sizes (small and large)
Both the toppings and sizes need to have a price

Once pizza toppings and size selections are made, display a sum constructor

------
Create a pizza constructor
  w/ properties like toppings and sizes

a pizza method to add up the cost of the pizzas

Maybe a pizza constructor to hold the order of pizzas

Give pizza toppings and sizes a value in html form checkboxes
